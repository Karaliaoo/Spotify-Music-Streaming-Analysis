# Spotify-Music-Streaming-Analysis

## Executive Summary

- Combined Spotify Top 200 charts, audio features, and listening patterns to identify factors that influence music popularity and chart longevity.

- Developed a structured SQL workflow to standardize track identifiers, remove duplicates, and create an analysis-ready dataset.

- Early insights show:

  - A small number of globally popular tracks account for most total streams.

  - Popular songs typically share a “hit profile”: mid-tempo, medium energy, and emotionally neutral characteristics.

  - Lifecycle patterns differ across regions and between explicit vs. clean versions.

These findings support strategic decisions around release planning, playlist placement, and region-specific marketing.

## Problem Statement

This project analyzes Spotify audio features, engagement metrics, and popularity trends to understand what drives streaming success.

- Identify audio feature patterns—examining danceability, energy, valence, tempo, acousticness—to understand which traits correlate with high popularity and streaming volume.

- Compare artist and track performance across regions to detect geographic differences in listener behavior and market strength.

- Analyze temporal trends to see how music characteristics and popularity metrics evolve over time.

- Evaluate chart performance dynamics, including velocity, longevity, and breakout patterns.

## Motivation

- Streaming dominates modern music revenue, making data-driven insights essential for artists and labels.

- Understanding which musical characteristics resonate helps optimize:

  - Content strategy

  - Release plans

  - Playlist and editorial positioning

  - Regional marketing

- Audio feature and engagement analysis also reveals how listener preferences shift over time.

## Key Recommendations
1️⃣ Release Strategy Using Hit Profiles

- Use the discovered “hit profile”: mid-tempo, medium energy, neutral mood, acoustic-leaning.

- Test a mix of long-life tracks vs. fast-impact tracks per release cycle.

- Validate by genre before treating it as a universal rule.

2️⃣ Fast-Viral vs. Slow-Burn Playlist Experiments

- Build playlists for quick-spike songs vs. long-growth songs.

- Track peak position and weeks on chart.

- Adjust results for editorial exposure and social boosts.

3️⃣ Region-Specific Marketing Using Local vs. Global Artist Footprints

- Use regional share metrics to classify artists as local vs. global.

- Focus regional promotion where each artist is strongest.

- Adjust scores for market size and Spotify penetration.
