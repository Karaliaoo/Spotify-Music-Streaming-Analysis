# Spotify-Music-Streaming-Analysis

##Executive Summary

- Combined Spotify Top 200 charts, audio features, and listening patterns to identify factors that influence music popularity and chart longevity.

- Developed a structured SQL workflow to standardize track identifiers, remove duplicates, and create an analysis-ready dataset.

- Early insights show:

  - A small number of globally popular tracks account for most total streams.

  - Popular songs typically share a “hit profile”: mid-tempo, medium energy, and emotionally neutral characteristics.

  - Lifecycle patterns differ across regions and between explicit vs. clean versions.

These findings support strategic decisions around release planning, playlist placement, and region-specific marketing.
